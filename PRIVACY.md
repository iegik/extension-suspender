# Privacy Policy

## What Data Do We Access?

This extension requires access to tab information, including tab URLs, for **technical purposes only**. Specifically, URLs are read to determine whether a tab is eligible for suspension. For example, the extension checks if a tab uses special protocols such as `file://`, `about:`, `data:`, `chrome:`, and similar, which should not be suspended for technical or security reasons.

## What Data Do We Store or Transmit?

- **We do NOT collect, store, or transmit tab URLs or browsing history.**
- The extension does **not** send any tab or browsing data to any third party.
- The only information stored locally is the tab ID of suspended tabs, which does not contain any URL or browsing content.

## Why Do We Need This Access?

Chrome requires extensions that manage tabs to have access to tab information. This is necessary to:
- Determine if a tab can be suspended (by checking its protocol or other technical properties).
- Perform the suspension and restoration actions correctly.

## Commitment to Privacy

Even though the extension has access to tab URLs for technical checks, **no browsing data or URLs are collected, stored, or shared**. All processing is done locally and solely for the purpose of providing the tab suspension functionality.

If you have any questions about privacy or data handling, please contact the developer.
